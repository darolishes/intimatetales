a) Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install react react-dom nodemailer
```
b) Run the codebase (in parallel if necessary):
```bash
npx parallel --halt --jobs 4 node_modules/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js build
npx parallel --halt --jobs 4 node_modules/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js start
```
Note: The above commands assume that the codebase is located in the current folder. If it's not, you'll need to provide the correct path.
