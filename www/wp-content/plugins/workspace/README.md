Based on the given information, I will assume the following core classes, functions, and methods that may be necessary in the code:

Core Classes:
1. IntimateTalesPlugin: The main plugin class responsible for initializing and managing the plugin functionality.

Core Functions/Methods:
1. activate_plugin(): A function/method to activate the plugin.
2. deactivate_plugin(): A function/method to deactivate the plugin.
3. init_plugin(): A function/method to initialize the plugin and register necessary hooks and actions.
4. enqueue_scripts(): A function/method to enqueue necessary scripts and stylesheets.
5. register_shortcodes(): A function/method to register custom shortcodes used by the plugin.
6. render_shortcode(): A function/method to render the output of a shortcode.
7. process_form_submission(): A function/method to handle form submissions from the plugin's frontend.

Now, I will proceed with creating the necessary files and providing the code for each file, starting with the entrypoint file.
