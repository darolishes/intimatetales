Now you can run your React application by running `npm start` or by visiting <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.

You also have a working Dockerfile, so you can build and run the container using the following commands:

1. Run `docker build -t llama-chat .`. This will create a new Docker image named "llama-chat" from the contents of the current directory.
2. Once the build is successful, you can run the container using `docker run --name=llama-chat-container -p 7543:7543 -p 7542:7542 llama-chat`. This will start two containers listening on ports 7543 and 7542, exposing the API server and the LLM server, respectively.

You can now visit <http://localhost:7543> to access the LLM chat interface. Note that this only works if your host machine has an active internet connection and is running a compatible version of Docker.
