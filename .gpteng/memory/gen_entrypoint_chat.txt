To complete the setup, you need to perform a few additional steps.

1. Start the backend server in a separate terminal using:
```css
cd backend
python app.py
```
This will start the API for generating text and images using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and the stable diffusion model.

2. Start the frontend development server in another terminal using:
```java
cd frontend
npm start
```
This will start the React application, which will connect to the backend API to generate text and images. You can now access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Once you have completed these steps, you should see a functional IntimateTales chatbot with customizable settings and npc avatars.

Remember that this is just an example setup, and you may need to adapt it to your specific use case or environment.
