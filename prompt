Backend Integration for Signup:

Connect the signup form to your backend. Implement an API call in the signup component to register new users.
Handle responses and errors appropriately.
Form Validation:

Add client-side validation to the signup form to ensure data integrity (e.g., email format, password strength).
Authentication and Security:

Implement secure authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Ensure passwords are hashed before storing them in the database.
User Feedback and UX:

Provide user feedback for successful registration or errors (e.g., user already exists, invalid data).
Enhance the user experience with loading indicators during the API call.
